Tomorrow Britain will make a choice that will define the next decade. The Guardian’s independent reporting has never been more critical.

In the run-up to the election, on the day, and in the aftermath: we are dedicated to bringing our readers accurate, measured, comprehensive coverage – so you can make up your mind based on fact, not fiction.
